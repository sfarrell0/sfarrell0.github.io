        <p> Hey, I'm Sam Farrell. I'm a recent CS graduate from the University of Utah. I'm enthusiastic about Machine Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision. 
            I love building applications and furthering my knowledge by picking up new technologies and libraries.  
            Much of my work to date has been in Python; whether through my coursework, 
            internship at the Air Force Research Lab, or personal projects. See below for a more comprehensive summary of my experience.</p>
